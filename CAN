General:

- broadcast type: every device can "hear" signal
- retransmit available
- hot pluggable
- 2 MBit/s
- Node: CAN_Tx & CAN_Rx (not used to communicate to other node == Digital Signals) => better use differential Signals (CAN transceiver)
- Digital Signals => transceiver => Differential Signals (CANHigh & CANLow)
- Node Controller + Transceiver
- +- 5 V => noice cancelling == detecting potential deifference (+- 10V)
- dominant: logic 0(CANHigh - CANLow = ~2V); recessive: logic 1 (CANHigh - CANLow = 0V)
